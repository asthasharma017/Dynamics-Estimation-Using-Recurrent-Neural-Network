# Dynamics-Estimation-Using-Recurrent-Neural-Network
This is a recurrent neural network to estimate a response to a sequence of manipulation actions. The motion in this project is pouring (represented with angle) and the response is the change of the amount of water in the pouring cup (represented with weight).
